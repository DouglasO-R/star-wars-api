# Star Wars Api

## About
Mentoring project with Instructor Marcio V. Martins,
to create an api (CRUD) in kotlin

## API

The goal for this exercise is to learn the initial building block of spring boot with a controller,
a service and a repository.
The most important is not to finish the challenge, is to learn Kotlin, 
the IntelliJ and the introduction to Spring Boot.
Try to no only copy. Before you copy it, give yourself at least 10-15 seconds to see if 
you can remember how to do it. Avoid try and error.
Do mistakes it is fine but try and error does not help to fix the information.
